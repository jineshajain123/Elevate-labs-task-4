In this project, a comprehensive Power BI dashboard was developed to analyze Blinkit's ecommerce performance. The dashboard leverages data from multiple sources, including orders, products, customers, and regional sales, to provide key business insights. KPI Cards showcasing Total Sales, Total Orders, and Active Customers for a quick overview. Sales Trend Analysis using line and bar charts to display month-over-month sales performance. Product Insights such as top-selling products and category-wise sales distribution. Regional Analysis with maps or pie charts highlighting performance across different locations. Customer Behavior trends, including repeat purchases and frequency of orders. Interactive Filters and Slicers allowing dynamic exploration based on date, region, or product category. This dashboard empowers stakeholders to make data-driven decisions by identifying growth opportunities, underperforming areas, and seasonal patterns.
